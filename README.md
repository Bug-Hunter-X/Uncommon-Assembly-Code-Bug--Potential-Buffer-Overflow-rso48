This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in assembly code.  The issue involves a potential buffer overflow caused by an unchecked index in memory addressing.  The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version that includes bounds checking.  This example emphasizes the importance of careful memory management in low-level programming.
